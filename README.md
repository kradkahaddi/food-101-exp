# food-101-exp
Challenge for fellowship ai 

This repo will include the main jupyter notebook that was used for the [food 101 dataset](https://course.fast.ai/datasets).
The model is also included as an export pickle and '.pth' for anyone who wants to experiment or verify the results. For any information on how to use these model files, please refer to this [tutorial](https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.inference.html) and for inference learning you can use [this](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson1-pets.ipynb) and [this](https://docs.fast.ai/basic_train.html#_learner_interpret).

Please note: model files are too big for github. Here is the kaggle dataset [link](https://www.kaggle.com/aashishghosh/food-101-fastai-trained-model) instead.
